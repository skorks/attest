able to go through all the ruby files in the project and run any tests that are found 
able to print progress to the commandline as tests are being run 
do not pollute the core classes unnecessarily

able to go through all the ruby files in supplied directory running tests when found

- the most basic result output DONE
- able to detect when test expectation fails DONE

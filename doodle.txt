rough features 

most basic
- setup and teardown DONE
- specify test for regular public method DONE
- specify test for a private method DONE
- ability to read instance variable of object under test without having to specify a reader DONE
- the most basic result output DONE
- able to detect when test expectation fails DONE
- execute tests for single ruby file if any present DONE
- able to detect when test errors out and gracefully say so in output DONE
- all object to have a should_equal expectation method DONE
- all objects should have a should_not_equal expectation method DONE

- should be able to specify a test anonymously without providing description
- ability to give a test an id as well as description
- ability to specify that no setup or teardown should be run for the test
- ability to specify multiple setups and teardowns and register specific setups and teardowns to run for specific tests
- ability to magically include module in an object and test its methods while it is included in an object
- should provide the error message if test errors out  DONE
- should provide the error trace if a test has errored DONE
- all objects have access to a should_raise expectation DONE
- should be able to produce a summary of execution at the end, with count of successes, failures and errors DONE
- should be able to produce shorthand output while running with a summary at the end (test unit style shorthand), controlled by cli parameter
- should have a should_fail expectation, possibly for tests that haven't been implemented aliased to not_implemented, not_implemented_failing, not_implemented_passing
- should have a should_be_true expectation type for more flexibility DONE
- test that are defined without a block should be tagged as not implemented in the output and in the summary
- you can require the library without augmenting objects with extra methods, only when you call do objects get augmented and should test for the fact that a method we're trying to augment with already exists, alternatively, don't ever require this library directly then we don't have an issue DONE

- the should methods should return an expectation object (itself) DONE
- when deliberately failing should not actually print an error but should be a failure with a message instead DONE
- the output writer should be a separate class to allow for different writers DONE
- work out what methods need to be on the output writer class and hook them in where tests are run DONE
- work out what other expectations need to be on the execution context intself (should_raise, should_be_true) DONE
- work out how to easily implement negation of the positive expectations on the execution context
- hook in configuration into the framework DONE
- make it configurable via configuration and command line the name of the method that begins a test context (this_tests)
- make it configurable via config and command line the name of the method that would produce an expectation object (itself or should), these are the only methods that extend core for now
- try to execute existing method missing and if still an error then execute my method missing and fall back to existing method missing, so that don't accidentally kill method missing functionality that people wrote themselves
- produce a short format output writer as well as a basic long format one to make sure that have ability to hook in different output writers
- should be able to configure attest via file (attest.config in same directory, or give location of config as command line param, or via .attest file in home dir or via a configuration block in a file under test, each level can override the other)
- what expectation methods are actaully needed on the objects in the test methods themselves (should_be_true, should_equal etc) work out negation for these ones as well 
- what methods should the expectation object have and how to allow to chain the methods and have everything work 
- all test context should have an id and if one is not provided it should be generated
- all test methods should have an id and if one is not provided it should be generated 
- before and after blocks should be able to refer to tests they are targeting by the test id
- test should be able to specify if they don't want the befores and afters to be run for them (this will take precedence over everything else)
- need to have a should_fail execution context method, with alias of fail  
- should be able to call should_be empty on an object where empty is a method on the object, should_equal size 5 where size is a method on the object, i.e. boolean method on the objects gets used as a predicate
- a expectation that this object as the same as another object, i.e. exactly the same object not an equal one
- for exceptions, should_raise(XyzError) {x.some_call}.with_message(/some message regex/), the XyzError and the regex should be optional DONE
- test methods in a module that is built for class inclusion
- test free floating methods that don't belong to a class or a module
- an anonymous test without description similat to the test pile below but still for only one thing
- a test pile method where you want to test random methods or do lots of assertions at the same time without having to think of a name for it, should introspect somehow what is/will be run and work out descriptions from that
- ability to define matchers as lambdas would be good i.e. obj.should_be happy where happy is a lambda that returns a boolean value



- a rake task to run the tests instead of a separate executable, configuration should be done through the rake task
- ability to mock stuff out using some of the popular mocking frameworks, ability to plug in different one by config, including my own by default which hasn't been written yet
- potentially later on think about doing nested contexts as well as shared contexts
- some way to potentially work out if files are ruby even if no .rb extension or alternatively pass a glob on the command line to match files
- allow redefining of the name of the main context method through the command line(e.g. rather than this_tests allow person to name it whatever they want)


- kill the This class and turn it back into a this_tests method on Kernel DONE
- merge everything into Master DONE
- branch master into a Hooks branch and leave to have a look at later DONE
- remove the hooks stuff from master DONE
- add the file in which the tests were found to the output of the tests DONE
- add functionality to allow a directory with ruby files to be parsed for tests and all tests to be run if any are found, non-recursively DONE
- add functionality to allow a directory to be parsed for tests recursively DONE
- allow multiple context within the same file to work properly and execute properly DONE
- make sure can test methods in a module not just in a class, magically included in a class DONE
- make sure can test class methods DONE
- make sure can test methods that don't belong to a module or a class DONE
- when multiple contexts in the same file, only print the name of the file to the command line once DONE
- don't print summaries after every context, only a totals summary at the end DONE
- make it so that tests can take an options hash and one of the options should be to not run setup or teardown for the test, perhaps make it not part of the opts hash DONE
- should be able to specify a test without a body for it to appear in the output as pending DONE
- refactor all example code so it is a bit nicer and more representative DONE
- once all the above are done, create some RDOC documentation to describe the basic features and usage of the framework DONE
- also fix up the description and extended description, make sure everything looks proper as far as doco is concerned on github etc. DONE
- if everything is ok at this point, do a first public release of the gem (give it an appropriately betaish version number) DONE
- make sure the gem is available through rubyforge as well as wherever else is appropriate, e.g. gemcutter DONE


next release

$ test out with method missing defined on the class, does it still work ok, essentially call the original method missing first, catch appropriate exception out of there and then run my method missing code and if still no good then propagate the original exception DONE
$ make sure if method missing is defined it is tried out first before the new_method_missing on kernel takes over (this is very similar to the one above), need a test here
$ integrate mocha so that can mock using mocha, this should be relatively straight forward DONE
$ mocha should be set up as a configurable parameter even though it will be the only test double capability available DONE
$ try out using mocha within the framework on another project totally separate, to nut out how it should be not made a runtime dependency but can be used when pulled in to the other project as a development dependency or a default dependency, also if not using bundler at all and it is not installed, what happens DONE
$ refactor how mocha gets included into the project  DONE
$ make sure the binary is only used to read the command line and calls down to other methods to actually load the test files and begin execution of all the tests including outputting the summary at the end DONE
$ output calculations of expectations not just tests, relatively straight forward and is a good idea DONE
$ allow expectations to be specified directly as tests (perhaps failures should contain the block that has failed), the test passes and fails and the floating expectation passes and fails will probably need to be reported separately DONE
$ if we get a test failure, perhaps more of a message regarding where/why the failure occured i.e. which expectation actually failed DONE
$ create a failures only output writer DONE
$ create a test/unit style output writer the one with the dots DONE
$ allow the different types of output writer to be configured as the one to use via command line parameter DONE
$ should be able to disable a test so that it is not executed, but is listed as disabled in the output DONE
$ refactor the command line handling to split out actual cli stuff from the attest code that acts on the cli params DONE
$ should be able to configure attest to be used without any test double framework at all DONE
$ create a better examples directory more consistent test naming etc DONE
$ combine assertion reporting and test reporting, we only really care about assertion reporting, no need to print out separate line for both DONE
$ ability to provide multiple directories, files from which to pull the possible tests DONE
$ ability to provide multiple directories, file which should be excluded from possible tests DONE
$ need to refactor my execution context for less duplication and more consistency DONE
$ rename before_all to be before each DONE
$ need a before_each and a before_all which gets executed before all the test in the group, currently have a before_all which really acts like a before_each not good DONE
$ possible bug or unexpected feature, if test contains no assertions in the output then it is treated by the output writer as having an implicit assertion/expectation (a success expectation) this is ok I think DONE
$ currently unable to specify expectations in before_all and after_all and have them be picked up, this should work, expectations should belong to the test container rather than to any specific test object, on second thoughts maybe shouldn't have expectations on before and after all DONE
$ should be able to specify expectations on the before_each and after_each DONE
$ more different types of expectations, should_equal(5){5}, should_not_equal, should_be_same(obj), should_be_same_as, should_not_be_same, should_not_be_same_as, should_not_fail, should_pass, should_be_around(6){5}.plus_minus(1), should_be_a/an(some_lambda){"hello"}, should_match/should_match_a/should_match_an, more thought regarding how to specify a custom matcher, something for arrays and hashes, should_include(some_array), perhaps ability to do blocks and do without blocks i.e. should_include(5, some_array) DONE
$ refactor expectations so that they can be used without a block but simply with parameters DONE
$ need to refactor my output writers to extract all common functionality so that there isn't so much code duplication (perhaps using modules or something) DONE
$ create a rake task that can be easily configured into a rake file with all the relevant configuration values so that attest can be run through rake instead of just the command line DONE
$ timing for how long it took to complete the whole test suite DONE
$ better failure reporting DONE
$ modify the readme, mention the problems wil inline test definition, mention the new expectations, mentiont about the new output writers, mention how output reporting works, disabled tests, test double framework configuration, inclusion and exclusion, before_all and before_each, mention the rake task DONE


$ BUG: I think I am now counting expectations passes rather than test passes, since i am getting ran 6 test 7 successful for mocka tests, need to look into this further DONE

$ POC perhaps hold off until next release, ability to actually convert a block to a string to be able to provide more information regarding what actually failed, essentially will need proc.to_s code DONE
$ POC remove trollop as a dependency to minimize dependecies, either that, or pull the trollop code in directly to minimize on dependecies, see if it's possible to easily acomplish this with git, if not then just manual DONE
- POC once test double functionality is in, see what we can do about writing some tests for this framework using itself, even a minimal test suite will be better than nothing
$ POC rake task that can easily be configured in a project to configure all the moving parts and run attest via rake (e.g. rake attest) DONE
- POC expectations on objects themselves, see if this can be done in such a way as to make it possible to include that bit separately via a separate require or command line paramter or rake config or all of the above
- POC hook in autotest somehow
- POC write some smarts about requiring things maybe even do this as a separate gem similar to require_all but with even more smarts and potential configurations call it require_bot
- POC own test double framework first only for ability to simply provide stubs, also ability to do mocks that verify expected behaviour, possibly two modes, one that complains when unexpected methods are called within test methods, the other mode is the opposite, is fine with unexpected methods, but complains when expected methods are not called, mock and stub class and instance methods, mock on just one object or all objects of the type, probably should be its own gem as well
$ POC support to allow more traditional i.e. non-inline creating of test in which case perhaps the if env block should not be necessary, tests will live in an attest directory, whatever once again should work via executable as well as rake task, all the smarts that we need to get this to happen DONE

next release 2

- figure out if mocha works properly when using bundler, my guess it will not
- if mocha not working properly get it to work with bundler correctly, maybe need to add a parameter to say which bundler group moacha is in
- need to be able to define helper methods within tests somehow that can be called from within tests and setups etc.
- timing for each test as well as each container should be recorded even if not outputted
- refactor the duplication between the attest executable in bin and the attest rake task
- figure out a better way to read/execute tests if they are defined inline, perhaps the file needs to be parsed lexically and the inline test bit pulled out and run as its own separate file, maybe through creating a temp file or even just able eval the block somehow without need for temp file, but will need to keep track of line numbers from original file somehow and will need to make sure that proc to string still works correctly in this case
- as part of the spec test suite create a set of blackbox tests that replicate the functionality in the examples directory to test that actual functionality is working correctly, perhaps create some sort of testing output writer and use that for asserting stuff possibly, these will esssentially be acceptance tests
- create a better set of unit tests, essentially need more unit tests, try to test what the methods do as opposed to simply testing that methods get called
- still more matchers, should_be_around(6, :plus_minus => 1){5} that should work for floats also, maybe give ability to do predicate matchers, i.e if objects responds to a question mark method like include? should be able to do should_include 5, some_array, also think about a good way to create more flexible matchers, more flexible than lambda based ones so that can supply parameters to matchers
- see if possible to integrate another test double framework besides mocha, like rr or shoulda etc.
- allow for multiple before and after blocks should be able to essentially have specific before and after blocks run for specific tests, perhaps using some kind of id marker for tests 
- some way to share the expectations that you have created yourself amongs all the different tests in different files, as long as matchers can be specified in a separate file they can be shared using requires, perhaps matchers should be pre-parsed out of all the test files beforehand, which means we perhaps need to pre-parse all the tests before executing them
- ability to run tests in parallel in multiple different ruby processes (depending on how many processors you have, configurable) then aggregate all the results, unit test parallelisation, ability to declare some test classes as non-parallelisable in which case they execute in a traditional fashion after all the parallelised tests have been run
- ability to only run unsuccessful tests from a previous run, only the fails and the errors, the slowest test from previous run, this means that need to keep state of previous run perhaps save it in a file in the current project, location should be specifiable i.e. .attest.state
- ability to configure the attest parameters via configuration file in the top level directory of the project i.e. .attest.config
- build out the rake fucntionality with ability to run a single container/file, or even a single test from that file, perhaps by line number, all the other crazines should also be possible such as all failing tests from previous run, all error tests from previous run, slowest x tests from previous run 
- ability to run only the tests that were run on the previous run
- hook in autotest to be able to have tests executing in a automatic fashion
- sandboxify the execution context class that I am using a little bit more, by remove irrelevant methods etc.
- update the readme with all the relevant new details 
- don't forget to bump the version before releasing the gem

next release 3
- pull in tests from other files into current file easily, all tests from another specification block should be able to be pulled into the current block, this may be of limited usefullness
- allow expectations to be made on objects themselves, this needs further thought and perhaps can be controlled by parameter
- write and integrate own test double framework, simple at first with basic stubbing and mocking functionality (look at rr for syntax suggestions)
- come up with some more useful expectations, both on object and as standalone methods of test
- look into rails stuff regarding expectations and idioms etc
- should somehow be able to require all the necessary ruby files that are needed when a test is run for the test not to fail, e.g. because ruby files depend on other ruby files
- look into doing helpful things for testing web stuffs
- look into doing stuff to make railsy testing easier 
- build out the unit test suite fully 
- figure out a way to do acceptance level tests, i.e. black box functionality tests pehaps something that will build the attest gem, then install it the take a project with sample tests in it and copy it somewhere and then use attest to run the tests in that sample project the results should be written somewhere and not just outputted to the cli, but do need some way to set expectations of failure and success so that when new tests are added to the suite they get picked up automagically, perhaps some sort of debug/testing mode, but need a way for people to not be able to easily enable it, maybe this can be done through the description of the tests which can be parsed for what the expected result is 
- ability for people to define their own output writer and hook it in for attest to use somehow
- output writer functionality should be separated more from the actual outputting of stuff so that if people define their own output writer they can simply reuse all the calculations without having to do it themselves
- see how easy it would be to provide nested contexts what that would entail and how it would effect everything, should be reasonably straight forward with recursiveness etc, but will need to think about a more scalable way of nesting in the output writers etc., need to study how these work in more detail
- see how easy it would be to provide shared contexts, need to study how these work in more detail
- look at what unit testing frameworks provide as far as rails support is concerned and how easy it would be to provide similar support, i.e. maybe through railties or whatever, only for rails 3 etc

bug 
- when requiring ruby files in another ruby file that one seems to inherit the tests from the other one DONE 
- have a look at doing a similar thing for load method, i.e. myself call new load with an introduced new paramter, and only in that case should the env var for attest be set otherwise even regular load should ignore the if attest block, only if it look slike being an issue
